# Kultak√§mmen v3

Personal portfolio page done with modern technology and methods. Jamstack is a popular new stack to create modern websites. Tools used in this project include Gatsby, Netlify CMS, GraphQl, Auth0, Netlify Identity and Stripe.

This site is my personal playground where I add and remove features as I see fit. Technical debt be damned? I have had a fake eCommerce store here with Stripe as my payment processor. I once had Auth0 as my authentication for accessing my portfolio page. Now I have Netfli CMS so I can adjust the text from my frontpage without touching this code.

Useful tutorials and codes that I have used to learn new tricks include but are not limited to:

This project used Stackrole.com's amazing `gatsby-starter-foundation` template to get the project kickstarted fast and efficiently. All the thanks to the wonderful people over at Stackrole:

Plans for v4:

- Rework Authentication so it only requires one-time registeration
- Add eCommerce features back with real products.
- Rework code that it's 100% from me.
- Perhaps add a Vlog or Blog.......
